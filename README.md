# OnKeylite - Scale Practice 
OnKey is a practicing aid tool for musicians of all levels, that generates scale and chord exercises.
Just enter a few basic parameters and get the music NOTES for your exercise.
For all instruments and all levels.
As we all know, every musician must (or should) practice his/her scales and chords on his/her instrument.
Yes, learning by ear, or by heart is important, but sometimes it helps to SEE the music NOTES while practicing, leaving the player to concentrate more on the execution, the HOW, and less on WHAT to play. 
This is where OnKey comes in.
Instead of reading in some method books of scale practice, and instead of writing the exercise down (either by a teacher or the student himself) just generate your exercise by inserting a few simple parameters and... happy practicing.
We at OnKey wish you a happier more productive time when practicing your instrument.

TO THE SHED !!!
